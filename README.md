I built the project entirely with Nextjs and used Node, MongoDB and Express on the backend. But I can't deploy the product anywhere despite trying a lot. Eg: Deploying to firebase, Netlify,  versal etc just shows an error. That's why I'm sharing the image of my localhost and the github link of my project.


### Technology :-

• Frontend : CSS, Scss, Material Icons, JavaScript, Next JS. 

• Backend : NodeJS, Express, Mongo DB.

• Deploy Tools : Firebase, Heroku, Github.
